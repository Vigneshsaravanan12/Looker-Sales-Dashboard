## 🔁 Project Workflow

1. **📦 Dataset Creation using SQL**
   - Generated base datasets using raw transaction data
   - Joined and filtered across customers, orders, products (SKUs), and payments
   - Final dataset exported to CSV for visualization

2. **🐍 Python Analysis**
   - Performed data merging and cleaning using Pandas
   - Exploratory analysis using Matplotlib and basic KPIs

3. **📊 Looker Studio Dashboard**
   - Created a multi-section dashboard to display:
     - Revenue KPIs
     - Monthly sales trends
     - Category-wise and payment method performance
